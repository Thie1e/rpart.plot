# rpart.plot
Adds an option to display confidence intervals for probabilities in plots of rpart decision trees

Implements the idea from this [blog post](http://exploringdatablog.blogspot.de/2013/08/assessing-precision-of-classification_6.html). 
It may not be theoretically sound, though, so take the returned intervals *with a grain of salt*.
